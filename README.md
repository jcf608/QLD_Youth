# Queensland Youth Justice - Use Case Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains research, use case analysis, and documentation related to the Queensland Department of Youth Justice case management system (Unify) and potential opportunities for enhancement through the UTS/OPTIk Program.

## Background

The Queensland Department of Youth Justice uses **Unify**, an integrated digital case management system custom-built by the state government. Unify began development in 2019 to streamline child safety and youth justice operations, replacing the older Integrated Client Management System (ICMS).

## Project Scope

This project explores potential pro bono opportunities to enhance operational efficiency and service delivery across multiple personas in the youth justice ecosystem:

- **Case Managers** - Managing youth aged 10-17 in the justice system
- **Victim Support Coordinators** - Providing crisis intervention and court navigation
- **Program Managers** - Overseeing rehabilitation and intervention programs
- **Frontline Officers** - Community corrections and field supervision
- **Strategic Planners** - Executive-level policy development and reporting

## Use Cases

Detailed use case scenarios are documented in:
- [ScenariosForQLDYouth.md](./ScenariosForQLDYouth.md) - Persona definitions and pain points

## Key Challenges Identified

- Data fragmentation across multiple legacy systems
- Manual reconciliation and reporting processes
- Limited field access to case information
- Inconsistent inter-agency information sharing
- Program effectiveness measurement gaps
