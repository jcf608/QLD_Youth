Queensland Youth Justice Case Management System
The Queensland Department of Youth Justice uses an integrated digital case management system known as Unify. Unify was custom-built by the state government, rather than procured as a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) or SaaS product. This system began its development in 2019 as a central project to streamline child safety and youth justice operations for the state.

Unify replaces the older Integrated Client Management System (ICMS), offering enhanced integration, secure information sharing, and coordinated casework between multiple government agencies. Its build was targeted specifically to Queensland’s policy and operational requirements, rather than on a SaaS or COTS base. iTnews - Qld Child Safety taps Deloitte to assess core IT system.itnews+1​
